# Market-Regime-Detection-Using-K-Means

Project uses simulation, scaling, clustering and prediction to model closing price data, identify different regimes in it, and make predictions about new data points. This provides a quick way to characterize market conditions based on closing prices.

The key benefit is getting a perspective on the market regime through unsupervised learning. The limitations are use of only closing prices and simplicity of the clustering. But overall it demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for analysis and prediction
